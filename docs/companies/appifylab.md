## First Round Questions

[Online Round Problem Set](../resource/appify/Online_Round.pdf)

<article>

Given multiple test cases, each containing a 3-letter string (uppercase/lowercase letters), you have to check whether the string equals "YES", case-insensitively. Output "YES" if it matches, else "NO".
</article>

<article>

Given
- Number of students, games, and connection events
- For each student, the game they like
- A sequence of connections between pairs of students over time

For each game, determine the earliest time when all students who like that game become connected (either directly or indirectly). Output -1 if they never get connected.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- Number of questions
- For each question: initial score, per-minute penalty, minimum score
- For each question: submission time and number of submissions (positive if solved, non-positive if unsolved)

Calculate the total score based on a formula involving penalties and number of attempts. If a question is unsolved, its score is 0.
</article>

<article>

Given a list of unique 9-digit phone numbers. For each phone number, find the shortest digit substring that uniquely identifies it (i.e., no other number contains it as a substring).
</article>

<article>

Given:
- Number of dishes, adults, and kids
- For each dish: happiness value if eaten by an adult or by a kid

Assign one dish to each person (adult or kid) to maximize the total happiness. An adult eats the entire dish; a kid partially eats it.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- A list of item costs
- A limit on the total increase Sabbir can apply to the item costs

Sabbir increases item costs (total increment ≤ limit) to minimize the final score difference in a turn-based game where players pick items alternately and optimally.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- A circular string of length N×K representing N fragments of length K
- A list of G candidate fragments (all distinct)

Determine if the circular string can be split into a sequence of N valid fragments (from the candidate list) in some rotation. If possible, output any such valid sequence.
</article>

<article>

Given multiple test cases, each with two numbers: total artifacts n and a position k. Artifacts are arranged in a special sequence: first all odd-numbered ones, then multiples of odd numbers (2×odd, 3×odd, etc.) in order, skipping duplicates. Find which artifact appears at position k.

</article>

<article>

Given grid dimensions n × m. Determine if it is possible to assign pigment values to rows and columns such that every cell in the grid (combining row and column pigment modulo nm) has a unique value. If possible, output the row and column pigments.
